## ES Explorer

Explore all the JS features available for your favorite ES Version.
This project is inspired from [Sarah Drasner's](https://github.com/sdras) Array and Object Explorer. I personally felt, how awesome it will be if we have something similar to showcase JS features released for every new ECMA version. That's how this idea was born.

I will share a snapshot of the app's progress below.

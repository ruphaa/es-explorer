## ES Explorer

Explore all the JS features available for your favorite ES Version.
This project is inspired from [Sarah Drasner's](https://github.com/sdras) Array and Object Explorer. I personally felt, how awesome it will be if we have something similar to showcase JS features released for every new ECMA version. That's how this idea was born.

The MVP of this application is done. For now, I've included only ES6 features. The rest of the ES versions are work in progress. Once I've updated the rest of the versions(up to date releases), I'll tweet about it [here](https://twitter.com/ruphaaganesh) and update the website and repo.

Interesting note: This site is responsive and sooner will become accessible.
